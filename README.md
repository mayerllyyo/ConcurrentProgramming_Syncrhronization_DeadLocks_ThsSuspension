# **Concurrent Programming and Synchronization Exercises – Software Architectures**

## **Description**

This repository contains a set of practical exercises focused on concurrent programming, race conditions, thread synchronization, 
and deadlock prevention, developed as part of the Software Architectures course at the Escuela Colombiana de Ingeniería Julio Garavito.

The exercises are implemented in Java and explore key concepts such as the producer-consumer pattern using wait/notify, 
shared data synchronization across threads, and thread coordination in high-concurrency simulations. Students analyze CPU usage,
 detect and fix concurrency issues, and implement efficient, thread-safe solutions using Java concurrency utilities.
